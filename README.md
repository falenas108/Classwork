This repository contains a few scripts I created to analyze data for several physics labs.  
ESR is for the Electron Spin Resonance Lab

MathMa contains Mathematica files, mostly for a neutrino lab.

Nuclear contains a simple model for a self-sustaining nuclear reaction, represented as a 
cylinder.  It would test to see the conditions where k>1.

Optical Pumping contains scripts for a lab about the optical pumping of an atom.
